VDR Plugin 'dynamite' Revision History
--------------------------------------

2011-01-06: Version 0.0.1

- Initial revision.

(developing and releasing were fast the last days
 so skipping some meaningless changes...)

2011-01-08: Version 0.0.4a

- rework patch for vdr to it won't collide with other patches
- LSTD outputs an asterisk behind the number of the primary device
- the number corresponds to the index in the array so it won't
  change for one device if others are attached/detached.
- DETD called with a number tries to detach the device at the
  given position in the array.

2011-01-09: Version 0.0.4b

- protect device array with a mutex
- add Service Interface "dynamite-AttachDevice-v0.1" and
  "dynamite-DetachDevice-v0.1"
  the pointer passed in "Data" is interpreted as a devpath like
  the SVDRP command ATTD and DETD.
  Returns always "true" on these commands even if Data is NULL
  as suggested in the docs.
- don't detach device which are receiving something with a
  priority > 0.

2011-01-09: Version 0.0.4c

- add new commands for locking/unlocking devices so the can
  be protected from accidently detaching (LCKD / UNLD)
- extend the Service interface with these commands
  "dynamite-LockDevice-v0.1" / "dynamite-UnlockDevice-v0.1"

2011-01-11: Version 0.0.4e

- add new command SCND

2011-01-11: Version 0.0.4i

- now it seems to work... :-)

2011-01-27: Version 0.0.4j

- add "GetTS" watchdog
- detach player and transfer mode on detach so all handles are freed

2011-01-27: Version 0.0.5

- add udev monitor for auto attaching new dvb-frontends
- you can use "dynamite --log-udev" on the vdr commandline for logging
  lots of udev events

2011-01-27: Version 0.0.5a

- refactor udev wrapper

2011-01-29: Version 0.0.5b

- add new command "SDGT" for setting a default "GetTS"-timeout for all attached
  and "to be attached" devices
- add "dynamite.DefaultGetTSTimeout" to setup.conf
- speed up dvb-device creation
- add alternate (more readable) commands for SVDRP like "AttachDevice" for "ATTD"

2011-02-02: Version 0.0.5d
